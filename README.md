# iumrah Android

Native Android client for the same iumrah platform used by the SwiftUI client and iumrah Business.

## Non-negotiable parity rules

- Backend base: `https://iumrah.app`.
- Android does **not** create or own a separate HOTELS/BOOKINGS database.
- Booking/account/hotel/flight contracts are ported from the current iOS source of truth.
- Production package pricing is server-authoritative. The diagnostic local fallback mirrors the current iOS fallback.
- Package markup fallback is **50%** on full supplier cost; payment fee is **2%**.
- Round-trip/open-jaw fare remains one complete provider journey fare; never sum two independent one-way fares.
- Hotel price unit remains USD per room/night × rooms × actual nights.

## Update workflow

After the initial GitHub workflow is installed manually, GPT patches use root-level:

`iumrah-android-update-*.zip`

The CI workflow safely extracts the patch, removes the ZIP, commits, rebases and pushes. Build is manual via `workflow_dispatch`.

## Current production checkpoint

Current parity/release checkpoint: **Stage 16 / v34**.

- Current iOS feature/UI parity through v33.
- Google Play production identity: `com.iumrah.app`.
- `compileSdk = 36`, `targetSdk = 36`, `minSdk = 26`.
- Play Billing/subscriptions are not part of this build.
- Release AAB is built through `scripts/build-play-release.sh`.
- Native libraries are checked for 16 KB page-size compatibility before release.

Design baseline: `docs/IUMRAH_GALAXY_UI_STANDARD.md`.
Release guide: `docs/release/GOOGLE_PLAY_RELEASE.md`.

## v35 Google Play non-Billing release gate

Google Play Billing is intentionally not part of this application. v35 removes the remaining legacy Billing source/docs stubs and makes Billing absence a production invariant: the resolved `releaseRuntimeClasspath`, merged release manifest and final AAB must all be Billing-free. Release identity remains `com.iumrah.app`; signing configuration is unchanged.

## Google Play CI v36 hotfix
The release workflow staged at `docs/release/iumrah-play-release.yml` now uses `android-actions/setup-android@v4` because Google removed the legacy Android SDK package `tools`. It also accepts the older `IUMRAH_UPLOAD_*` signing secret names used by previous iumrah workflows.


## v38 Google Play release verifier hotfix
Stage 8 now rejects only real credential/signing files instead of any filename containing the word `keystore`. This prevents update ZIP filenames from falsely blocking CI while preserving the no-secrets-in-repository gate. Stage 19 verifies this invariant.

### v39 Google Play ZIP-safe release tooling
Release verification no longer treats normalized Unix execute bits as a missing AAB builder. All release shell scripts are invoked explicitly via `bash`, so ZIP/mobile patch extraction can safely produce mode 0644. Stage 20 guards this behavior.

## v41 production Kotlin compile repair (2026-10-08)
The GitHub production build now reaches Kotlin compilation. v41 fixes every compiler diagnostic from run `logs_102435360209.zip` in one cumulative patch and adds a fail-fast debug+release Kotlin compile preflight before lint/R8/AAB packaging. Google Play Billing remains absent from the resolved release runtime classpath.


## v42 — Android release lint diagnostics

Based on CI run `logs_102450458969.zip`: Kotlin debug and release compilation,
unit tests, and resolved no-Billing dependency gates passed. `:app:lintRelease`
reported 3 errors; its console output included only the first,
`ContextCastToActivity` in `ui/account/AccountScreens.kt:511`.

This patch fixes that error (and updates the analogous account security path),
and keeps `lintRelease` strict. If remaining lint errors exist, the build now
prints **all error file paths, line numbers and lint IDs** to the GitHub log.
Do not claim release-AAB completion until `:app:bundleRelease` succeeds.

## v43 — remaining release lint fixes

CI `logs_102463053359.zip` reported exactly two errors: unobserved `StateFlow.value`
inside `GuestLoginCard` and an unused `AnimatedContent` target in Booking.
Both are fixed in the source; Lint is not disabled and no baseline added.
Stage 23 guards these changes. Release `.aab` remains unverified locally.

### v44 production resource fix (2026-10-09)
- Fixes release `mergeReleaseResources` / AAPT2 failure caused by `iumrah_esim_home_card.png` containing JPEG bytes.
- The asset is now a genuine PNG at the same Android resource name; UI references do not change.
- Stage 24 verifies image signatures across Android `res/` before release build.

## v45 Google Play 16 KB verifier correction (2026-10-09)
The release AAB already builds and signs successfully. The post-build native verifier now applies the 16 KB ELF alignment gate to the 64-bit ABIs used by 16 KB devices (`arm64-v8a`, `x86_64`) and treats 32-bit `armeabi-v7a`/`x86` alignment as informational while still requiring matching 64-bit counterparts.
